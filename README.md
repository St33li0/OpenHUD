# OpenHUD
Free, Open-Source HUD for MX Bikes

---

# Why?
Recently I have noticed a few minor bugs in the common plugin: MaxHUD for MX Bikes and came to realise that it is closed source. Or at least as far as I can tell, please create an issue if you know otherwise.
This is why I have decided to make my own HUD plugin for MXB and ensure that it remains open-source and maintained.
Also because learning :)
