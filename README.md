# Why?
<p>Recently I have noticed a few minor bugs in the common plugin: MaxHUD for MX Bikes and came to realise that it is closed source. Or at least as far as I can tell, please create an issue if you know otherwise.</p>
<p>This is why I have decided to make my own HUD plugin for MXB and ensure that it remains open-source and maintained.</p>
Also because learning :)
